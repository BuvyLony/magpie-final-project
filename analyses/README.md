# Analysis

## analysis_1
This is our analysis script, which also includes the code for the plot in our paper.
We had to change this plot, as well as a typo mistake after we submitted the script to apply it to our final data.
It is divided into:

- Reading data
- Cleaning data
- Data wrangling
- Frequentist analysis
- Bayesian analysis
- Plot

This script is also using the folder "stan_models" where we excluded the code for the Bayesian models we used.

## stan_models

## data

Those are the resulting plots we combined to include in our paper
